I used to think you could get away with little to no gear on a hike in Colorado. Embarassed to admit that, on my first hike after moving here in the summer of 2016, I carried a heavy insulated bottle and _nothing else_ up to Saint Mary's Glacier as my first hike at altitude, ever. Things have definitely changed in the 5+ years since then.

When preparing for any high elevation peak, I follow a formula to pack my bag. Hopefully my method helps you pack for your own peaks, too! Or at least encourages you to consider some new items to bring along on your next ascent.

## Clothes

The first and maybe most important items you'll pack for a 14er are the clothes you wear.

You might have heard the phrase "cotton kills". It's an aggressive way to say cotton products are likely to run you cold if you sweat and can therefor be unwise in a life-threatening situation. Synthetic fabrics are a great option for this reason- you won't soak in your sweat as they typically wick moisture away from your body, and they tend to run a reasonable temperature regardless of conditions (i.e. stays cool in the heat & stays warm in the cold).

### Layers I Wear

My preferred set of layers for any climb are as follows:

- Tear-proof climbing tights or loose-fitting synthetic pants
- Synthetic shirt: long-sleeve in temperatures under 25℉, sleeveless above 75℉, short-sleeve in between those
- Long-sleeved wool layer (zip-up for cooler temps, synthetic quarter-zip for warmer)
- Wool socks in every season

### Layers I Pack

Whatever you don't wear, you should have packed. Some of these items could be considered survival gear.

- Puffy jacket, packed down. A nanopuff-type material is ideal for this as it takes up the least amount of weight and space. Even in the summer I find I use my puffy, if not just on the summit itself.
- Combination wind & rain layer for whatever weather occurs.
- Extra hoodie. Even on top of the wool layer, it's nice to have one with a cinched hood ready to layer under your wind layer if things start to get intense (as they often do above 13k).
- Extra socks, gloves, beanie. Again, in all seasons. Summer in front range isn't quite the same as summer at double the elevation.

## Survival Gear

### Satellite Communication Devices

## Snacks & Hydration

- I've started packing liquid powder packs to substitute Gatorade on summits.
