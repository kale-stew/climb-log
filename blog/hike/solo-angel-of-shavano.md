Why I wanted to solo a couloir.

Spring conditions are funny

## Getting to the Lot

4x4 road to the parking lot through some farms, passed a lot of deer on the way in.

Something big behind me when I got out of the car to pee

Elk scared me, stayed in the car an extra 45 until there was more light

## On the Summit of Mount Shavano

### Making a Decision

I chose not to connect Tabeguache from this point not just because of the clouds I saw forming around me, but because of the deep snow and lack of trench along the traverse.

## Descending Off the Peak
