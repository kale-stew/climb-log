Spring is a notoriously transitional time, and this is especially true in Colorado. With spring comes slightly more stable snowpack and prime couloir climbing time. "Couloir" is a term of French origin that refers to the deep and steep gullies that cut up a mountain, and plenty of these lines exist on some of the most beautiful mountains in the state.

While avalanche danger isn't negligible in the spring, it is significantly decreased as snow no longer accumulates on top of the cold, hard early season snow and the prolonged sun exposure stabilizes snow fields, making them less likely to slide.

When done right, a couloir can essentially be an icy staircase for one to kick-step your way to a summit. In less stable conditions, however, the icy staircase is less reliable. This is why it's important to know _how_ to climb in addition to knowing when. Solid knowledge is a critical part of any snow activity, and this is true in couloir climbing as well. To learn more about the techniques involved, I would recommend first reading ['Mountaineering: Freedom of the Hills'](https://www.rei.com/product/128238/mountaineers-books-mountaineering-freedom-of-the-hills-9th-edition?sku=1282380001) (considered the benchmark publication for anyone looking to learn or improve their mountaineering skill technique), and then taking an in-person class with [Colorado Mountain Club](https://cmc.org/Classes/CMCClassesandSchools/TechnicalClimbingSchool.aspx).

While this trip report is less of a how-to on couloir climbing, I will give some advice for anyone looking to do their first couloir climb:

1. **Start early.** Earlier than you think you need to. Conditions only deteriorate as the sun starts to hit the couloir, ideally you want to be off of your peak before noon. Early morning snow tends to be firm and consistent, but mid-morning and afternoon snow is a different, slushy story. In late spring, I've had my entire snowshoe frozen solid into a slosh of wet snow. Much like quicksand, spring snow can turn into concrete underneath the upper layers. Things can get scary quick.
2. Learn how to self-arrest, and then **perfect your technique.** Don't stop practicing. Keeping your axe out on any uneven terrain can help you get more comfortable with the casual cane carry, and you'll always be ready to self arrest even in low-level territory.
3. **Get comfortable with your gear.** This should be considered part of learning and perfecting the art of self-arresting; being comfortable with your snow gear is a big part of effective climbing technique. If you are spending time fumbling over your crampons or haven't figured out the best place to stash your axe so it's handy when needed, you'll find the climb a lot less enjoyable. Precious time can be eaten looking around for a specific snow tool, and you won't have time to make choices in an emergency. Having your beacon, shovel, probe, axe, helmet, and crampons all well positioned is key to a successful snow climb on any mountain.

## Choosing my Route

In May of 2021, I set out to pursue a low-level couloir climb solo. I had read about the Angel being a nice winter alternative to the standard route up Mount Shavano, and I was eager to get some time on my new crampons. I had pulled them out on 13ers in the Tenmile range over months prior, but hadn't really gotten to use them on a long, dedicated climb yet. The Angel of Shavano seemed like a nice opportunity to use them while still being fairly safe enough for me to solo.

## Getting to the Lot

The drive down to the Shavano/Tabeguache trailhead in Salida was fairly uneventful. The only real drama happened when I arrived in the lot at 3:45 AM without another vehicle in sight. I hopped out of my car to walk over to the bathrooms and immediately came face-to-face with an elk. I froze, took three steps backwards and got back into my driver's seat. Terrified of the elk and whatever his next move might be, I decided to stay in my car for a little longer and wait him out. 45 minutes later, the sun began to rise and he finally left the lot, and I was released from my tin prison.

## Starting the Hike

Knowing that I had a cool 3.2 miles to the summit, even with the couloir factored in, and my pace was averaging 2.2 miles an hour on recent peaks, I still felt confident going after my objective but knew in the back of my mind it would be smart to turn around if conditions appeared to already be declining when I got to the base of the Angel. I set off to check it out.

The first mile of the Angel's trail follows the standard approach. I enjoyed a beautiful sunrise in solitude, winding through golden-white aspen on a fairly level trail. Your first steep section comes right after a chance to sign the climb log. I took a moment to add my name, noting there had been no one on this peak even the day prior, before continuing along.

As I gained some elevation on the lower trail, I found myself hopping over large, downed trees and other avalanche debris. This would only get worse as I left the heavier-trafficked approach trail.

## Navigating Avalanche Debris

After about 1.2 miles of hiking along a comfortable 14er trail, I had to fork off to approach the base of the Angel. As is the case with any lesser-traveled section of trail, there wasn't a packed down trench to follow. I took a moment to strap my snowshoes to my feet and begin punching through the somehow both hard and soft snow.

Not solid enough to hold the weight of myself with my snowshoes, but not loose enough to sink me more than a foot into the snow, I opted to take my snowshoes off after a half mile of kicking through the debris into punchcrust. I stashed them at a tree, saved the waypoint to my Garmin, and continued along. While still frustrating, things were easier without those cumbersome snow floats strapped to my feet.

## First Look at the Angel

Maneuvering my way over heavy, downed tree trunks with sharp and spindly branches sticking every which way off of them, I slowly but surely made my way towards the base of the Angel. Its angle appears so gentle as you approach that it's easy to underestimate the slope.

While this is by no means an intense couloir climb and more of a casual couloir stroll, it's important to have your gear out and at the ready at the right time.

![Rock hopping. {576x768}](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51860808484_82f50043b5_b.jpg)

As I hopped over the last patch visible rock before beginning the steeper section of the Angel, I paused to put my crampons on. It looked like this would be the last spot I would be able to comfortably sit. After triple checking that I had secured them correctly, I continued up the peak.

## The Couloir Climb

Climbing this little couloir was a lot of fun. Finally getting a feel for that kick-step pattern, feeling out how much depth you actually have beneath you, and then making sure you didn't kick in too deep. You get into a nice flow state focusing on these smaller things. Again, the Angel is by no means an intense climb (I'm confident some more experienced mountaineers wouldn't even consider this a "real" couloir), but it's a nice way to get some practice in steeper terrain.

![Gaining the couloir. {576x768}](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51860808854_8a1266be76_b.jpg)

It's easy to make quick work of a slope like this when you've been rearing to go since the start of your morning. I found myself cruising up this hill and was surprised when I turned my head and saw the main trail meeting with my path.

![Standard trail visible to the left. {768x553}](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51860556693_10c454bb6b_b.jpg)

At this point I was making quick time of the peak. I chose to take a moment to really appreciate the views from this saddle and maybe try to spot any fellow climbers below. To my surprise, I could see no movement in the trees below or on the trail leading up to where I stood. As far as I could tell, no one else was out there with me. A true surprise given how beautiful and bluebird this weather had turned out.

I took another look around and began up the next high point I could see. It looked like things flattened out another 400 or so feet above me, so I decided to put my head down and go after that next highest point.

![Almost there! {768x492}](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51860474496_fe5cb188e1_b.jpg)

To my disbelief, this was the final summit push. I was technically cutting the traditional trail once again by hoofing it directly up the slope instead of switching back and forth, but it felt both easier and safer to go straight up in this snow. There were solid rocks for me to orient myself with, and the patches of snow in between were neither deep nor loose. I worked to make quick time of this final push.

## On the Summit of Mount Shavano

Suddenly, the terrain below my feet flattened out and the world around me opened up until I could only see other 14,000+' peaks surrounding me. It was an incredible feeling having only been moving for a couple of hours at this point.

I took the time to consider that Tabeguache traverse and decided against it. There wasn't a fresh track for me to follow, and I had already began my day later than originally planned. Connecting that peak might take me another hour each way if I'm quick. It wouldn't be smart, I decided, to continue on.

## Descending Off the Peak

![Dropping off of the summit of Shavano. {768x552}](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51860808999_30cde4ba36_b.jpg)

After taking a few extra moments to soak in that summit feeling, I began to descend a well-marked path that was a little different than the one I had ascended. This one did snake down the summit along a couple of switchbacks, and I passed a CFI sign identifying the summit area after dropping off the initial prominence.

Once I was off of the steepest section of rocky terrain and back into the more powdery snow, I glissaded whenever I could.

![Some of my less exciting glissade tracks off of the summit block.](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51861128735_0b889c4744_b.jpg)

Meeting that saddle where the main trail begins to snake back down a slope, I split back towards the couloir and continued to glissade, this time with my axe at the ready and no crampons on my feet. This was where I actually saw some speed.

Once at the bottom of the steepest section of the Angel, I turned around to assess my glissade track. To my surprise (for the third time today), storm clouds had begun to roll in. My decision to bail on the traverse was immediately validated. Even with the quick glissade down and patchy stretches off of the summit, I hadn't cut off enough time to be safely off the peak by the time those clouds released what they were holding.

## Finishing My Day

After spending a cool half hour stumbling back over my tracks and swearing at my GPX waypoint for not being more obvious to the naked eye, I _finally_ located my snowshoes and got fully below treeline. Getting back on the hard-packed main trail made the final section of descent all that much easier, and I got to my car just in time for the rain to start.
