On a random Thursday in July, I decided to target a scramble near our home in Clear Creek county. Herman Gulch is known for its vibrant and profusive wildflower season so it already seemed like the perfect time to go up that way, and the last time I had been in this area it was covered in snow and visibility was no further than 200' or so. I wanted to see what the basin looked like on a clear day but also get a mild and preferably lesser traveled climb in.

Comparing options in the area, The Citadel cropped up as a solid option because it had class 4 variations I could opt for (Pettingell or Bard Peak, other 13ers accessible from this area, are only class 2 from this side).

## Heading Up

The approach to this climb is an easy and popular day hike up Herman Gulch. At the top of the gulch, there's a large and shallow lake underneath the 13,553' (4,131m) Pettingell Peak that folks often stop for a mid-hike break. This is where you begin the variation to get up to the Citadel's southern shoulder.

There are wildflowers aplenty if you're hiking this in the early summer. Late June through mid-July is often the peak season to see these flowers, but it can vary season to season. Being such a lush valley, you can encounter some large crowds depending the day of the week during this time.

After turning left at the lake and heading up a narrow trail to a marshy area, you'll lose sight of cairns. As is the case with many 13ers, there's another path visible gaining the shoulder that I chose to cut the edge of the marsh to get to, but I'm sure there are alternatives that will take you directly to this path. For what it's worth, I did try to target that trail on my descent but did not find any well-traveled or marked connection back to the main path. You will need to bushwhack a little bit to get to this peak.

Once you gain the saddle between Hagar and The Citadel, Golden Bear and a section of the CDT come into view. The ridgeline connecting the two unofficially named peaks ("The Citadel" and "Golden Bear") looks daunting but doable. I made a mental note to come back here someday to see how doable it actually is.

## Beginning the Climb

After switching up the ridge through some steeper terrain, I finally got a good look at the climbing ahead.

_Looking at the route options to ascend: gully (C3) is to the left, chutes (C4+) to the right._

At this point I chose to put my helmet on and stash my poles so they wouldn't get in the way of my climbing. I knew there was a vertical c4+ (debatably c5, some folks recommended rope) chute to the right that I wanted to try. Upon closer inspection, it looked solid and I felt confident going for this 30 foot wall alone.

_Looking towards the chute I chose to climb, visible as a crack on the far right._

Admittedly I did hit my helmet once on a roof moving through the zig-zagged crack, but my helmet held up just fine and I didn't feel rattled so I continued up after a beat.

## Topping Out

Moving up this wall was the highlight of my day, and when I topped out after 10 minutes I felt giddy. I had done some class 4 peaks in the weeks leading up to this, but none of those were solo. This was my first time scrambling anything above c3 alone, and I was proud of what I had done!

Looking back, I saw a left over rope and anchor from someone's climb prior.

_Left over rope and anchor is visible at the bottom of this photo, the chute I've just climbed is on the right._

This was a humbling sight and brought back the reality that I was only halfway done with my day at this point. Sure, I had gained the chute just fine, but I still had to get back down and although I was hopeful the c3 gully would be a viable descent option, I still hadn't seen it firsthand.
