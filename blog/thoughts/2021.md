At the beginning of the 2021, I started to consider what kind of goal I could set for myself in the outdoors. Having only ever set running goals and not knowing where to begin for setting a larger goal in a different environment, I began to weigh a few options against each other. Did I want to pursue a specific number of high peaks? Finish summits within a list or range? A set number of days hiking, or should I just pursue a statistic? Maybe distance or gain? The more I thought about it, the more I realized I didn't want to go after a set number of summits because it put too much pressure on any one individual climb. Logging a certain number of days in the alpine also ran the risk of putting too much pressure on getting out when conditions might be otherwise sub-par just to satisfy a number.

Instead, I set my sights on a set statistic. Elevation seemed like a fun one to target, as it demanded a little more planning than just distance. After looking at the year prior’s achievements, I settled on a goal that was also a tribute to the year we had just entered: 202.1k’ (202,100 feet) of gain. This was 4x what I was able to climb while full-time employed the year prior. It was certainly going to take some effort, but it felt attainable.

I was excited about this goal because it posed a different kind of challenge. Did I want to exclusively go after peaks with a large amount of gain? Or did I want to pursue a mix of easier and more difficult routes? I needed to average ~17,000 feet each month to stay on track, and I quickly found myself ahead of schedule halfway through January. If I did decide to mix smaller climbs in with my larger days, I was going to make quick work of this goal. So I looked to diversify my routes even more.

### 14ers

- Climbed **31** 14ers
- Top 3 routes:
  1. [Pyramid Peak](https://kalestew.notion.site/Pyramid-Peak-924fb3288a654ed69d3d4fc1e084a8dd): climbing alongside mountain goats was the experience of a lifetime, but this class 4 route also has a lot of fun moves including a “leap of faith”.
  2. [Mount of the Holy Cross via Halo Ridge](https://kalestew.notion.site/Mount-of-the-Holy-Cross-via-Halo-Ridge-d293c97a885a4721bf9c6eeb6b67d182): a super rewarding loop and great way to start your season as you spend a few hours traversing a ridge above 13k. Sunrise on Holy Cross from the Notch shelter is indescribable.
  3. [Maroon Bells Traverse](https://kalestew.notion.site/Maroon-Bells-Traverse-3ee8a68ac1334e658e523c5bfd1821f2): I’ve heard folks call this a “one and done” type of route, but I would be happy to repeat it every year for the rest of my climbing career. The class 5 moves are involved but exhilarating, and the views of other Elk peaks are unparalleled from that saddle.

### 13ers

- Climbed **28** 13ers
- Top 3 routes:
  1. [“K2”](https://kalestew.notion.site/K2-Capitol-Peak-0a48efaa950749bb85ed60ed7f3f5760): Capitol Peak’s chossy 13,664’ neighbor, accessed from a beautiful backpacking route up to an alpine lake.
  2. [”The Citadel”](https://kalestew.notion.site/The-Citadel-via-Herman-Gulch-92720531255f4d29ad0a7717634d55e3): one of the peaks seen from Herman Gulch, this lesser-traveled peak has class 3 and 4 routes to its summit including a fun 40’ chimney.
  3. [Mount Sniktau](https://kalestew.notion.site/Mount-Sniktau-2fa7c780e25a4d2c8d888336768105f2): honorable mention because of its versatility. Being off of a paved mountain pass, this peak is easy to get to and offers a number of alternative combos if you want to add additional gain or views to your day.
